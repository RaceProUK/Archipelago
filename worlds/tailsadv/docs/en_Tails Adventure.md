# Tails Adventure

## What is this game?

Tails Adventure (テイルスアドベンチャー) is a mini-Metroidvania starring Miles 'Tails' Prower, released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear.

## What is the goal of Tails Adventure?

To drive the invading Battle Kukku Empire from Cocoa Island by infiltrating their Battle Fortress and defeating Dr Fukurokov, Battle Kukku 16th (a.k.a. Speedy), and ultimately Great Battle Kukku 15th, the leader of the Battle Kukku Army.

## Where is the options page?

[Player Options](../player-options) contains everything required to configure and export a YAML configuration file for this game.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The locations of the thirty items collected across Cocoa Island are randomized.

Two items are not randomized as they are always given to the player when starting a new game: the Regular Bomb and the Vulcan Gun.

## What are location checks?

Any of the thirty locations where an item is normally picked up. Most of these are simply capsules placed around the various levels, but a handful are dropped by bosses on defeat.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

All items can potentially appear in other players' worlds, with the exception of the Regular Bomb and the Vulcan Gun, both of which the player always starts with.

## When a player receives an item, what happens?

When an item is received while online, the item will be silently added to the player's inventory. There won't be an in-game notification to avoid interrupting gameplay at an inopportune moment.

Items received offline will be silently added to the player's inventory the next time they connect to the multiworld.

In both cases, the BizHawk Client will show a message for each received item.
